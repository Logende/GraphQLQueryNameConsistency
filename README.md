# GraphQLQueryNameConsistency
Deep Learning project to detect whether a GraphQL (name, query) pair is consistent.

## Dataset

A dataset has been created by scraping 1000 Github repositories that use the GraphQL Apollo Client library.
11646 (13377 minus 1731 because of removing some low quality entries with a filter) GraphQL pairs of queries, mutations and subscriptions together with their name have been extracted from those repositories.
They are considered "consistent" samples and located in the `dataset_generator/final_datasets/dataset_pos.json` file.
80% of the consistent samples have randomly been chosen and put into the train dataset, 10% into the validation and 10% into the test dataset.

Another 11913 (13377 minus 1464) "inconsistent" or "negative" samples have been generated by randomly mixing pairs of consistent name and query up.
This inconsistent dataset has been split into train, validation and test too.

## Fine-Tuning

Different attempts on fine-tuning have been made (see `finetuning` folder). 
The most successful attempt was fine-tuning base-T5 using the custom dataset.
